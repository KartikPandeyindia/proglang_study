I don't know what I am expecting from making this repository.
These repositories would majorly involve my practise in typing and learning these programming languages.
How do I make to do that?
1. I believe exploration of all, and new code in these languages would help.
2. I need to get my keys set on the keywords of these languages.
3. Lastly, I would use this repository as my notebook, where I could record how I feel for these languages.
